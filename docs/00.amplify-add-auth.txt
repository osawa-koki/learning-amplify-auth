amplify add auth
Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation

 The current configured provider is Amazon Cognito.

 Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? I want to learn more.

This utility allows you to set up Amazon Cognito User Pools and Identity Pools for your application.

Amazon Cognito User Pool makes it easy for developers to add sign-up and sign-in functionality to web and mobile applicati
ons. It serves as your own identity provider to maintain a user directory. It supports user registration and sign-in, as w
ell as provisioning identity tokens for signed-in users.

Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users w
ho have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your accoun
t.

If you choose to use the default configuration, this utility will set up both a Userpool and an Identity Pool.

If you choose the 'Default configuration with Social Provider (Federation)', the providers will be federated with Cognito
User Pools.

In either case, User Pools will be federated with Identity Pools allowing any users logging in to get both identity tokens
 as well as AWS Credentials.
